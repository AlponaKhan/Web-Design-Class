		<strong><u><mark>Bangladesh's stock market</mark></u></strong> has been going through a bear run for the <b>last two months</b> despite petering out of election-linked uncertainty, signaling that <i><u>the worries about the macroeconomic challenges are far from over</u></i>.Thus, the DSEX, the benchmark index of the <mark>Dhaka Stock Exchange</mark>, gave up 680 points, or 10 percent, in <u>the last two months</u>. Yesterday, it plunged 71.71 points, or 1.22 percent, to close the day at 5,762, <em>the lowest level in three years.</em>

		<small>The falling trend comes after the regulator lifted the floor price</small>
		, handing investors the long-awaited freedom to sell shares at their will, a liberty they could not enjoy for the 18 months to January this year owing to the artificial measure.After recovering from the lows caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the economy came under renewed pressure in the middle of 2022 after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out. The conflict crippled global supply chains, hurting import-dependent economies like Bangladesh since reserves began drying up.

		First the marsh grass came, then the motherwort,
		then bitterberry and honeysuckle. Blackbirds,
		gulls and grackles built their nests.
		Mourning doves call from the eaves
		of the old factory, closed during the Depression,
		though the building seems to be somewhat in use:
		a No Trespassing sign, an Elton John song
		coming in from someoneâ€™s bike stereo.
